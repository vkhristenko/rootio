# rootio project

## Roadmap
- _cpp_: establish a valid c/c++ core + extensions + tests. Include tests with original `ROOT` used for serialization/deserialization
- _arrow_: add support for arrow arrays storage
- _other languages: python_, `rust`. Build on top of the core already developed within c/c++.
